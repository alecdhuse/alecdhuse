## Welcome to my GitHub page.

- My name is Alec Dhuse; I'm a cybersecurity engineer and coder.
- I'm interested in threat intelligence, malware analysis, data visualization, web apps, and maps.
- I've created a static file analyzer called [Lantern Shark](https://github.com/alecdhuse/Lantern-Shark) that runs in the browser without sending files or data to the internet.
- I publish [reports](https://github.com/alecdhuse/Publications) on the interesting threat activity I find.
- I also write [detection rules](https://github.com/alecdhuse/Created-Detection-Rules) in a variety of formats.
